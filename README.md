# GARCH

Predicting volatility is extremely important for the survival of monetary funds. GARCH models have long been used for this purpose but Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) have increased in popularity and have been very successful in recent years. Although there is no acceptable proof that either is better, a new technique has emerged that involves combining the models and this may significantly improve prediction accuracy. The motivation of this study is to determine if the combined models outperform the separate models. In this study, there were three GARCH-type models tested: GARCH, EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH. Each of these models has certain parameters that must be estimated. Estimation of these parameters was done using a log-likelihood test. In order to maximize the accuracy of the ANN, multiple activation functions were tested. The tanh function performed the best. Each of the GARCH-type models was paired with the optimized ANN. A total of seven models (3 GARCH-type, 1 ANN, and 3 combined models) were compared using RMSE and MAE. The data used for this study was imported using the Yahoo Finance library. There were three indices used: Dow Jones Average, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq. These indices have different amounts of volatility which allow us to find the best model for each condition. When the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq datasets were used, the combined models were shown to be significantly better. In addition, the GJR-GARCH-ANN was the best model on all three occasions.
